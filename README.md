# Cat-Dog-Classification&Detection Application

## ‚ùó Description

The application aims to classify and detect cats and dogs in images. The application was built using streamlit and the model used were
1. CNN & VGG16 for Image Classification
2. YOLOV8 for Image Detection


## üíª Tech stack used

1. TensorFlow
2. TensorFlow Pre-Trained model (Transfer learning - VGG16 model)
3. Ultralytics(YOLOV8 model)
4. Streamlit


## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down the repository. You will need `tensorflow` and `streamlit` packages installed globally on your machine.  

`cd Cat-Dog-Classification-Detection`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To Start Streamlit Server:

`streamlit run deploy.py` or `python -m streamlit run deploy.py`
